A state-level committee has been formed in each of these states to coordinate the party's activities.

Volunteers will visit veterans in their homes, distribute informational pamphlets, and assist them in accessing available healthcare services. The party is also running a parallel social media campaign to bring the issue to the attention of the wider public and policymakers.",
  "news_article_4_title": "Public Opinion Divided on New Economic Policies, NEP Calls for Inclusive Growth",
  "news_article_4_content": "A recent nationwide survey has revealed a sharp divide in public opinion regarding the government's new economic policies.

The NEP has called for a more inclusive approach, suggesting measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the agricultural sector. The party plans to release its own economic vision document next week, which it says will offer a 'pro-people, pro-growth' alternative."
